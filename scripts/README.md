# Scripts layout

`scripts` is organized by responsibility. New code should import and execute the canonical paths below.

Evaluation commands and datasets live under `eval/`; see `eval/README.md`.
Main-site page routes and discovery tools live under `scripts/main/`; see [메인 홈페이지 크롤링 명령어](main/README.md) for full, category, page and limited-board runs.
Main-site collection settings are in `scripts/main/pages.json`. Its results share
`files/pknu_main/`, organized by site category and then file format. Incremental
state is in `_state/`; RAG intermediates are in `_derived/<logical-dataset>/`.

College, faculty, department, and major websites use the common department
crawler. Their explicit `storage_path` in `crawlers/departments/registry.json`
places each dataset under `files/department/<college>/<faculty-or-department>/<major>/<dataset>/`.
Levels without a separate organization/site are omitted; a website shared by
multiple majors stays at the faculty level and is stored once. Independent
faculties use their own name as the first level. The existing dataset alias
(for example, `ce`) remains the leaf folder and document identity is preserved.
Each dataset keeps `output/{json,html,files,images,runs}`, `state.json`,
`preprocessed/`, and `vectorized/` inside that folder.

```text
files/department/
├─ 공과대학/
│  ├─ coe/                                 # college website
│  ├─ 화학공학과/chemeng/
│  └─ 기계공학부/기계학전공/me/
└─ 정보융합대학/컴퓨터·인공지능공학부/ce/    # shared faculty website
```

Existing department directories can be reorganized without crawling:
`python -m scripts.migrations.crawler_storage --department-layout` previews
the moves; add `--apply` to move them and update local JSON/JSONL references.
The command refuses destination collisions and records its verification in
`files/department/_migration/`. Legacy flat folders remain readable for older
checkouts that have not yet been migrated.

├─ rule/                 # rule preprocessing and priority commands
└─ tests/
```

Tests are grouped by the feature they verify:

```text
scripts/tests/
  core/          # shared crawler contracts, storage, logging, repository layout
  departments/   # department discovery, CMS adapters, registry and transport
  main/          # main-site routes and student-life page collectors
  media/         # body images, OCR, layout classification and review
  fixtures/      # shared offline test inputs
  _paths.py      # stable project and fixture paths
```

Run all tests from the repository root with:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -t . -p "test_*.py"
```

Canonical crawler commands:

```powershell
python scripts/crawlers/departments/engine.py --dataset ce --once
python scripts/crawlers/pknu_notice.py --recent-only 1
python scripts/crawlers/pknu_student_life.py --mode guide --limit 1
python scripts/crawlers/pknu_rule.py --laws --max-law-items 1
```

The former crawler and root-level common-module paths have been removed. Internal code, jobs, and documentation must use the canonical paths above.

`sites.csv` is the address catalog and may contain sites that are not yet crawler-compatible. `registry.json` contains only configurations with verified menu paths and board IDs. A registry entry links back to the source catalog through `source_catalog_key`.

Department catalog and discovery commands:

```powershell
python scripts/crawlers/departments/cli.py validate
python scripts/crawlers/departments/cli.py probe --site-key ce.pknu.ac.kr
python scripts/crawlers/departments/cli.py discover --site-key ce.pknu.ac.kr
python scripts/crawlers/departments/cli.py discover --dataset ce
```

`probe` performs a shallow homepage fingerprint check. `discover` first requires a compatible probe, then inspects same-host numeric menu pages and writes candidates under `files/_discovery/<site_key>/`. Discovery output is never merged into `registry.json` automatically.

Layout-aware OCR RAG evaluation (isolated test store, never touches Supabase):

```powershell
python -m scripts.rag.ingest_layout_data            # files/_reviewed/body_image_ocr/*.reviewed.jsonl -> files/_test_db/test_layout_rag_YYYYMMDD/
python -m eval.tools.generate_testset               # <= 50 QA pairs -> tests/eval_dataset.csv (--mode rule: no API cost)
python -m eval.tools.run_evaluation                 # -> eval_report.md (+ .json)   (--retrieval-only: no API cost)
```

Tables are chunked as markdown (header repeated per chunk), diagrams are rewritten as sentences, and every chunk keeps `provenance` (source path, image hash, review/extraction origin). Test store names must match `test_layout_rag_YYYYMMDD[_suffix]`. LLM calls go through `eval/tools/llm_budget.py`: at most 3 attempts per call, a hard per-run request cap, and no retry on 400/401/403/404. `scripts/tests/fixtures/layout_rag/` holds a synthetic fixture with the same schema for smoke runs.
