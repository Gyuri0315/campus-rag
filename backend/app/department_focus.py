"""Keep answers to one department when a question names it.

School-wide notices attach one table covering every department (전과 세부
선발기준, 졸업자격인증제 실시 현황, 부·복수전공 선발기준). A question about
one department ("컴공으로 전과하려면?") then retrieves whichever slice of that
table scores best, often another department's rows, and the answer quotes
them: on 2026-10-26 "26학번 컴공 졸업인증" was answered with another
department's TOEIC 700 and "컴공 전과" with another department's 4 advisor
meetings. retrieval._focus_department() drops table chunks that list other
departments but not the asked one, and pulls in the asked department's slice
of the same table.
